    "## Introduction to Craters on Planetary Surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Cratering is an important process that has altered the surface topography of the Earth, other terrestrial and icy planets, and both rocky and icy moons, within our solar system and probaby others. That is - cratering is quite a uniform process. However, although we understand the process of cratering quite well, we only have a limited understanding about how a cratered surface influences the role of other surface processes. For example, on heavily cratered surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, which have not been altered by plate tectonics like on Earth, how do the craters affect the flow and collection of water? of wind? and of the sediments transported by water and wind? These are funamental questions in our understanding of planetary bodies. Looking at the surfaces of the 4 rocky planets in our solar system, Earth is the odd one out, with topography dominated by mountains and basins created by plate tectonics. Based on this knowledge, what do you expect other planetary surfaces in other solar systems would look like, cratered or Earth-like? \n",
